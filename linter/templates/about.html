	    <h2>About Newslint</h2>

	    <p>
	        In consumption and analysis of the news, half the battle is deciphering the intent and agenda behind the text to see if it's giving the story a fair take.  Newslint identifies <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_language">loaded language</a>, potential biases, punditry, partisanship, unprofessionalism, and other problems with text.  Not all of its warnings will apply (false positives, particularly), but hopefully it will make you aware of issues with the text you consume daily.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    	There are different dimensions behind whether news is worth reading or not: which source it came from, who was quoted, phraseology, time spent exploring multiple sides of an issue, experience of the author with the topic, etc.  This seems to be more of an art than a skill but perhaps a raw cursory linting of a news article can classify the text for us initially and programmatically.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    	For me personally, curation of the news is an enjoyable task.  Picking out which stories have new data, which don't falsely present stories, which give a hard take on a subject both in objective reality and in a sense meaningful to the players involved in it -- these are the components of a healthy fascination with the news.  Naturally there are only a handful of very good curators who know which news will stick and which news is fluff -- without a disdain for fluff! -- and so we need better tools for the rest of the time when we're braving the cold world of terrible reporting by ourselves.
	    </p>

	    <h2>Rules</h2>

	   	<p>
	   		In <a href="https://github.com/Xeus/newslint/tree/master/rule">the newslint repo</a>, there are several classifications of rules:
	   	</p>

	   	<ul>
	   		<li><a href="https://github.com/Xeus/newslint/blob/master/rule/language.py">language</a></li>
	   		<li><a href="https://github.com/Xeus/newslint/blob/master/rule/partisan_slang.py">partisan slang</a></li>
	   		<li><a href="https://github.com/Xeus/newslint/blob/master/rule/pundit.py">punditry</a></li>
	   		<li><a href="https://github.com/Xeus/newslint/blob/master/rule/rag.py">rag source</a></li>
	   		<li><a href="https://github.com/Xeus/newslint/blob/master/rule/sensationalism.py">sensationalism</a></li>
	   	</ul>

	   	<p>
	   		By no means are these rules comprehensive.  They should also not be expected to be perfect or to be exclusive -- any type of word that comes down on the left or right of politics should be worth flagging in the rules.

        <h2>API</h2>

	   	<p>
	   		Newslint has <a href="/api/v1/">an API</a>.  You can list news clippings that were saved publicly, view a specific clipping, or even add clippings.  Example input/output is available through the <a href="/api/v1/help/">API help endpoint</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			To lint some text:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				GET: <a href="http://{{ get_url }}?content=test%20string">http://{{ get_url }}?content=test%20string</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				POST: <a href="http://{{ get_url }}">http://{{ get_url }}</a> using the key "content" for the text to lint, plus the variables below; won't save your data
			</li>
			<li>
				Send a POST request to <a href="http://{{ get_post_url }}">http://{{ get_post_url }}</a> to submit info to the database; WILL save your data
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Variables:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>title</strong>: a title for the saved news clipping</li>
			<li><strong>content</strong>: the block of news text to lint</li>
			<li><strong>publication</strong>: publication from which the clipping belongs</li>
			<li><strong>url</strong>: URL for the publication, if online</li>
			<li><strong>author</strong>: author of the news clipping</li>
			<li><strong>published</strong>: date published by the source/author (ex: MM/DD/YY)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Eventually in a future version, hopefully, you will be able to queue a site to be linted or have stats run on all the clippings saved.
